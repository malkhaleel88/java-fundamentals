- ### **Files : "Main.java", "Main.class" inside "src" folder in project directory.**

- ### **Methods :**

* **pluralize()**:  This method accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an “s” if the number is zero, or greater than one.

* **flipNHeads()**: This method accepts an *integer n* and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row. Simulate coin flipping by choosing a random number between 0 and 1. Numbers **below .5** are considered **tails**. Numbers at and **above .5** are considered **heads**.

* **clock()**:  This method uses Java’s built-in LocalDateTime object to constantly print out the current time to the console, second by second. The program should run until someone manually kills it with **CTRL-C** or presses the**stop** button in their IDE.
